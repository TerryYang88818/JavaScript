I am a middle-aged salesman working in a foreign company. 
With the increasing of age, sometimes I'am worried about my job in the future.
People rarely see older salesman, don't they? 
If you don't want the layoff happened on youself, you'd better prepare earlier.
How to do? Maybe learn some useful skills is a good choice.
